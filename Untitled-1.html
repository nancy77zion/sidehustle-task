                To the world you were one person, but to me you were the world. You didn’t have much, but we always felt like we had everything. You didn’t leave millions in your bank account, but you left a legacy worth much more
                You taught me love, patience and endurance. You taught me how to pray and led by example. You praised me whenever I did good and pointed out my mistakes with that gentle voice. You encouraged me to work hard in school and taught me to read and write. I still remember your voice as you encourage me. I think about you every day.   
                You were precious a gift from God, so much beauty, grace, love and patience you possessed. You touched my heart in so many ways, your strength and smile even on dark days made me realise I had an angel beside me.

                <pre><b>                    Mother, you were just a girl,
                            So many years ago.
                            You had your loves and had your dreams,
                            You watched us come and go.You watched us make the same mistakes,
                            That you had made before,
                            But that just made you hold us tight,
                            And love us all the more.We haven’t always thought about
                            The things that you have seen.
                            To us you’ve just been ‘Mother’,
                            No thought of who you’ve been.
                            But we remember now in love,
                            Your life from start to end,
                            And we’re just glad we knew you,
                            As Mother, and as Friend.
